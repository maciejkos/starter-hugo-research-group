To check what version of Android you phone is running, visit the page you are now on (cognition.nu/android) using your smartphone and click [this link](https://www.whatismybrowser.com/detect/what-version-of-android-do-i-have). 


You will see a screen that looks similar to the below screenshot. If the [website](https://www.whatismybrowser.com/detect/what-version-of-android-do-i-have) says that your version of Android is 7 or higher, you can fill out our [interest form]({{< relref "/enroll" >}}).
