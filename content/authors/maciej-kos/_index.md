Maciej Kos is a Ph.D. candidate in Personal Health Informatics at Northeastern University’s Khoury College of Computer Sciences and Bouvé College of Health Sciences. Kos’s research focuses on extending healthspan and amplifying cognition through individualized technology-enabled health interventions, computational modeling, and scientific discovery. 


Currently, Kos works on developing digital biomarkers of cognitive health for supporting interventions aimed at preventing or postponing the onset of neurodegeneration. In his research, Kos applies his interdisciplinary background in behavioral, computer, and health sciences to create individualized novel health technologies, specifically targeting marginalized and underrepresented populations. 


Kos’s work is supported by the NIH National Institute of Aging’s Transition to Aging Research training fellowship.
