Sumientra Rampersad is an Assistant Professor of Physics at UMass Boston and a Visiting Assistant Research Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Northeastern University. 

Sumientra received her Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees in Natural Sciences from the Radboud University in Nijmegen, the Netherlands. These programs included two years of fulltime research, which she completed at the departments of Applied Physics, Biophysical Chemistry, and Medical and Biophysics. After a period of traveling and teaching in Central America, she returned to Nijmegen to pursue a Ph.D. She worked at the Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre’s Department of Neurology for five years, where she performed research on transcranial stimulation and finite element modeling under the guidance of Prof. Dick Stegeman and Dr. Thom Oostendorp. After working on simulations for a biomedical company, Sumientra started a postdoctoral position at Northeastern University’s Center for SPIRAL, under the guidance of Profs. Deniz Erdogmus and Dana Brooks. In 2019, she established the Brain Stimulation & Simulation lab as a Research Assistant Professor at Northeastern. In 2021, Sumientra started a position as Assistant Professor at UMass Boston, where she established a second location for the BSS Lab. Sumientra lives in Boston, where she enjoys dancing, snowboarding, and cake (lots of cake).
