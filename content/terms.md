The goal of this research is to develop new mobile technology for monitoring changes in memory and attention. Your data may help develop new ways for detecting and tracking changes in cognitive impairments as well as advance our understanding of conditions such as mild cognitive impairment and subject cognitive decline. Your participation will likely help this research and technology reach its full potential.

The study consists of:

* Three in-person meetings in our lab, of 2 to 3 hours each. 
* The first in-person session will take place after you are enrolled in the study. The second meeting will take place after 6 months. The third meeting will take place after 12 months. 

The procedures that you will be asked to complete include:

* Allowing researchers to export your Android activity data, i.e., your movement data, what apps you use and when from your Google account, and to install a data collection app on your smartphone.
* During the 3 lab visits, you will be asked to answer brief demographic questions, complete a series of thinking and movement tasks, and have electroencephalography  (EEG) of your head.
* Throughout the 12 months of the study, you will receive, on average, one message every two days, and no more than two messages per day, on your phone asking you to respond to a brief question.
